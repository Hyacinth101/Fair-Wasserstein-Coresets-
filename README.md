# Fair-Wasserstein-Coresets-
Summer 2025: This repository contains research code and tools for constructing Fair Wasserstein Coresets â€” compact, weighted subsets of data that preserve Wasserstein distances while ensuring fairness across sensitive groups, enabling scalable and equitable machine learning and optimal transport computations.
